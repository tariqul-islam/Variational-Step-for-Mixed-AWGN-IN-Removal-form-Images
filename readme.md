This is the code for the paper: Mohammad Tariqul Islam, S. M. Mahbubur Rahman, M. Omair Ahmad, M. N. S. Swamy, "A Variational Step for Removal of Mixed Gaussian-Impulse Noise from Images".

The codes have been run and tested on MATLAB 2016b.

In order to run the mixed AWGN+SPIN examples run MBM3D.m or MLSMNLR.m or MWESNR.m file.

For mixed AWGN+SPIN+RVIN run MBM3D_RVIN.m or MLSMNLR_RVIN.m or MWESNR_RVIN.m file.

The codes of these algorithms have been collected from the authors' websites and have been modified for the paper.
